# Servo SG90 motor

The SG90 is a popular micro servo motor commonly used in robotics, electronics, and hobbyist projects. Here are some key features and specifications of the SG90 servo motor:

1- Features: 
- Compact Size: The SG90 is small and lightweight, making it ideal for projects with space constraints.<br>
- Analog Control: It uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control its position.<br>
- Torque: It can provide sufficient torque for small-scale applications, typically around 1.8 kg·cm (at 4.8V).<br>
- Rotation Angle: It can rotate approximately 180 degrees (±90 degrees from the neutral position).<br>
- Plastic Gears: The gears are made of plastic, which makes it less durable than metal gear servos but also more affordable.<br>

2- Specifications:
- Operating Voltage: 4.8V to 6V <br>
- Stall Torque: ~1.8 kg·cm (at 4.8V) <br>
- Operating Speed: ~0.1 sec/60 degrees (at 4.8V) <br>
- Dimensions: 22.2mm x 11.8mm x 31mm <br>
- Weight: ~9 grams <br>

3- Applications: 
- Robotics: Used for controlling small robot arms, grippers, or pan-tilt mechanisms.<br>
- RC Models: Common in radio-controlled (RC) cars, boats, and airplanes for controlling steering, throttle, and other functions.<br>
- DIY Projects: Suitable for various hobby projects, including animatronics, automated systems, and educational kits.<br>
